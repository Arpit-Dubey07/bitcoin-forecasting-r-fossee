# 📈 Bitcoin Price Forecasting Using ARIMA and TAR Models

This repository contains the work completed during the FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2024 at IIT Bombay. The project focuses on modeling and forecasting Bitcoin prices using time series analysis techniques in R.

## 📊 Project Overview

- **Title:** Analysis of Bitcoin Data: A Case Study on Modeling and Forecasting
- **Contributor:** Arpit Vinay Dubey, IIT Kharagpur
- **Mentors:**
  - Prof. Radhendushka Srivastava (Mathematics Department, IIT Bombay)
  - Prof. Kannan M. Moudgalya (Chemical Engineering Department, IIT Bombay)
  - Debatosh Chakraborty (Project Research Associate, FOSSEE R Team)

## 🧠 Methodology

The project involves:

- Data collection and preprocessing of Bitcoin price data.
- Exploratory data analysis to understand trends and patterns.
- Implementation of ARIMA and Threshold Autoregressive (TAR) models for forecasting.
- Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.
